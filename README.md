# ProductPricing
This was part of a Product Pricing project where I was responsible for creating a Descriptive Analysis Pipeline to generate insights for a posterior prediction of production quantity sale.

Analysis Pipeline Step-by-Step as follows

    Variable Identification
        Identify if the variables are categorical or numerical and change the type of them
    
    Univariate Analysis
        numerical variables
            distplots
        categorical values
            histplots
    
    Bi-variate Analysis
        correlation
            pairplot
            heatmap
        numerical x numerical
            scatterplot
        categorical x numerical
            boxplots
                with outliers
                without outliers
        categorical x categorical
            relplots
            
     Time Series analysis
         lineplot
